# Scout criteria

Criteria tell Scout which evidence qualifies a lead: the criteria text (ICP gate, evidence-based disqualifiers, size gate and A/B/C tier definitions) and research_fields. Read the saved criteria before editing. Lead evidence and grades are results, not criteria. Scout receives the confirmed commercial profile at run time, so keep commercial facts out of the text. Exclusions a search filter can express belong in Targeting; disqualifiers here need evidence.

research_fields lists the values Scout must find and report for every lead: `{key, description, type}`. key is a lowercase dotted path under Scout's custom fields (`gifting_occasion`, `portfolio.locations`); description says what to find and how to report it; type is text, number, boolean, list or object. Every listed field is required. The founder may add, edit or remove fields; preserve the others. CRM delivery mappings never define what Scout must research.

Author or regenerate the text with references.configuration and the actual current Scout base from setup_generation_context. Include persona role/tell, the primary motion, any operating-state split and evidence-based tier definitions; parked motions stay out of scope.

PATCH sends expected_version and at least one of text and research_fields. It is a synchronous revision: the server records the editor and the source versions, so never send them. Null clears text while history and pinned runs remain. A persona change goes through targeting with regenerated_criteria, not here. On VERSION_CONFLICT read the latest criteria and reapply only the intended change. Initial criteria creation belongs to setup. No criteria write connects an account, activates recurring research or starts outreach.
