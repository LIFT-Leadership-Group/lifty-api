# Sending accounts

A sending account is one LinkedIn account or mailbox owned by one sender
(`senders` guide). Every workspace uses the same operations; send the chosen
workspace as `references.common` describes. Customers never see the provider
behind Lifty's connection pages; do not name it.

## Read

`sending_accounts_get` (`lifty get sending-accounts`, optional query
`sender_id`, `channel`) lists accounts including disconnected history. Each has:

- `status`: `connected`, `needs_reconnect` (Lifty lost access; the person must
  sign in again) or `disconnected` (explicitly removed by the customer or an
  operator).
- `state`: `active` or `paused`, the account's own usage switch, independent of
  `status`.
- `checked_at` and `observation.state`: the last verified provider check and
  whether it is recent enough. `unverified` means the last known facts are
  older than the freshness window; it is not a disconnection and not a reason
  to reconnect by itself. Sending waits until a fresh check.
- `declaration`: what the person confirmed on Lifty's connect page.
- `sends`: sends today and over the last seven days.

Reads never check or change a provider. A failed read is unknown: retry it;
never report an account as disconnected or missing from a failed read.

## Connect

1. Resolve the person with `senders_get` and use their `id` (create the sender
   first only if absent). Ask whose account it is when unclear.
2. `sending_accounts_connect` with `{"sender_id":"<id>","channel":"linkedin"|"email"}`.
   Ask nothing else: Lifty's connect page asks the person's declaration (for
   LinkedIn, that it is their habitual personal account with no other
   automation tool; for email, a mailbox they already use or a dedicated
   sending mailbox), then opens the sign-in. Only Google is offered for new
   mailboxes. A sender has at most one LinkedIn account
   (`LINKEDIN_ALREADY_CONNECTED`: reconnect that one instead).
3. Immediately show the returned `connection_url` as a clickable link and say
   whose account it connects. Do not open it yourself. An open attempt for the
   same sender and channel is reused (`created:false`): show its link again.
4. After the person finishes, read `sending_accounts_attempt` with
   `path.id` = the returned `id`, with bounded backoff. `connected` gives the
   new `account_id`. A failed or timed-out read is unknown, not failure: keep
   polling the same attempt. `failed` reasons: `canceled` (sign-in not
   finished; offer a new connect when ready), `account_in_use` (the account is
   live in another workspace; another link will not fix it), `identity_mismatch`
   (another mailbox/profile signed in), `provider_rejected` (offer one new
   attempt, then ask for LIFT review). `expired`: start a new connect.
   When the sign-in is refused, the return page says why and offers "Try
   again" with the same link until the attempt expires. If it says an earlier
   Lifty connection still held the account, Lifty already removed that old
   link; the person signs in again with the same account.

Connecting never activates a campaign or sends anything.

## Reconnect

`sending_accounts_reconnect` with `path.id` = the account `id` returns a
`connection_url` like connect. The same mailbox or LinkedIn profile must sign
in; another one fails with `identity_mismatch`. After `needs_reconnect` the
account keeps its usage state. After an explicit disconnect it comes back
`paused` until resumed. Reconnecting never resumes or activates a campaign.
`CONNECT_UNAVAILABLE` means Lifty cannot reconnect this account through its
current sign-in; ask LIFT support rather than connecting a different account.

## Pause and resume

`sending_accounts_pause` / `sending_accounts_resume` with `path.id`, only when
the user asks. Pause stops new work on that account (in-flight sends settle);
resume makes it usable again only when it is connected and every campaign gate
allows. Resume refuses a disconnected account (`ACCOUNT_DISCONNECTED`):
reconnect first. Neither changes other accounts or activates a campaign.

## Disconnect

Only with the user's explicit yes in this conversation:
`sending_accounts_disconnect` with `path.id` and `{"confirm":true}`. The account
is paused and disconnected at once (new sends stop; already submitted sends
keep their history and limits), then Lifty removes its access at the provider.
200 means access removal is confirmed (`access_revoked_at`). 202 means the
account is blocked but removal is not confirmed yet: repeat the same request a
few times with short waits; no new consent is needed. If it stays unconfirmed,
tell the user the account is blocked and removal is pending, and repeat it later
on the same account. Never claim access was removed without `access_revoked_at`.
Other accounts are unaffected. To change mailboxes, connect the new one and
disconnect the old one.

## Email warmup after connection

Warmup, placement and inbox health keep their own operations. They take the
explicit `workspace` and, as `connection_ref`, the email account's `id` from
`sending_accounts_get`. With one email account, `connection_ref` can be
omitted; with several it is required and the operation returns
`EMAIL_MAILBOX_SELECTION_REQUIRED` without it. GET inputs belong in query;
POST inputs belong in body. Every workspace uses the same operations, and each
mailbox has its own warmup: starting one never stops another.

Warmup authorization is a separate Google step from the account connection.
Show the returned Lifty setup link for that exact mailbox; the owner must
choose the same Google account again. Warmup setup uses Google OAuth only.
Never request an App Password or route the founder to a password form.

After the email account is connected, call `warmup_status` and use its
`mailbox_use` and `recommended_go_live` to explain what happens next. Do not
compute dates yourself.

- `personal` (a mailbox the person already uses, declared habitual): no
  initial warmup period is required. Recommend warmup anyway: it runs
  alongside outreach and protects inbox placement and reply rates. The
  placement test needs the warmup setup; Lifty runs it once setup is done.
  Tradeoff: a warmup service gets access to the mailbox, and warmup emails and
  replies pass through the inbox. If the founder declines, do not start
  warmup; say Lifty cannot test the mailbox without it.
- `outreach` (a dedicated sending mailbox): warmup is required; call
  `warmup_start` right away. The mailbox needs a healthy check after 21 active
  warmup days, followed by placement, before it can send. Lifty starts that
  placement test by itself when warmup finishes. Paused days and days with a
  problem don't count, so the date moves later if either happens. Give the
  returned date and suggest what to prepare meanwhile: targeting, copy and
  schedule.

Once the initial period is complete (`initial_period_complete: true`), warmup
keeps running while campaigns send. Warmup holds the mailbox again only if
warmup emails start landing in spam: `spam.holds_sending: true` and
`recommended_go_live.kind: "held"`. Say how many landed in spam and that
only the spam hold clears after a later sufficient measurement is below the
limit. User pauses, disconnection and placement holds remain independent.
`warmup_ready` is warmup's contribution only. Campaign activation,
placement checks and campaign or sender pauses are separate; never claim
sending is enabled from warmup status alone.
Warmup never pauses or resumes campaigns.

`warmup_start` returns the setup link. Show it as "Set up warmup for your
mailbox". The page shows the mailbox, the sender name warmup emails will use
(from the sender's profile) and one "Continue with Google" button. Lifty sets
the warmup schedule and volume; the founder fills in nothing. The page also
says when Lifty sends one test email from the mailbox to about 20-40 test
inboxes (right after setup for a habitual mailbox, after warmup for a
dedicated one), and that continuing accepts warmup and this test. Say so
before sharing the link. Google must
verify that exact address before Lifty shares access with the warmup service,
once, without storing or logging the tokens. The setup flow does not create
another email address. If the returned link or status does not support Google
setup, report the actual blocker and involve support. Do not create another
account or invent a link.

After the founder finishes, read `warmup_status` again. The state moves from
waiting for authorization to warming after Lifty's next check. The setup page
says warmup is starting and usually starts within 20 minutes; that wait is
normal, not a stuck setup.
`warmup_start` fails with `EMAIL_CONNECTION_REQUIRED` until a connected,
verified email account exists, and with `EMAIL_WARMUP_MAILBOX_TAKEN` when
another Lifty workspace already warms the same mailbox. It fails with
`EMAIL_WARMUP_DNS_INVALID`, without creating a link, when the mailbox domain
has no valid SPF, DMARC or MX record. Tell the founder which record the
message names and call `warmup_start` again once it is published. After a
removal, status shows `Removed`; `warmup_start` can set up a new warmup with a
new link only when previous setup is resolved. An ambiguous handoff is never
retried automatically: check status and involve support, rather than trying
another account or bypassing the setup hold.

Disconnecting the email account pauses its warmup; reconnecting the same
account clears only that suspension, after health verification. A user pause
(`user_paused`) stays until the user explicitly resumes warmup; a connection
suspension (`connection_paused`) and any spam hold are separate.
Pausing the account itself (its active switch) stops
prospect sends only; warmup keeps running.

Use `warmup_pause`, `warmup_resume` or `warmup_remove` only when the founder
asks, with the same selectors in body. Lifty applies the request at its next
check. A pending removal wins over pause or resume, and resume on a running
warmup only cancels a pending pause. For a dedicated mailbox that has not
completed its initial period, pausing or removing warmup delays sending; say
so and get an explicit yes first. Report each mailbox separately.

## Placement tests

A placement test shows where a mailbox's email lands (inbox, spam or missing)
at Gmail, Microsoft and other providers. It needs the mailbox's warmup setup.
Read
`placement_status` with the explicit `workspace` and, when the workspace has
more than one warmed mailbox, its `connection_ref`.

Lifty queues one test by itself (`test.automatic: true`) once warmup runs on
a habitual mailbox, or when warmup finishes on a dedicated one. Accepting
warmup covered it, so do not ask for consent again or call `placement_start`
for it. The result goes to Slack when connected and by email to each member's
Lifty login address. It uses a fixed short business email signed with the
sender's signature, never campaign content. Repeated checks never start a
second automatic test. If it could not start and nothing was sent or billed
(for example, no test credits), Lifty tries again within a day.

Only call `placement_start` when the user asks for another test, after they
explicitly agree to what it does.
Mailivery sends one email from that mailbox to roughly 20-40 of its seed
inboxes, and each test uses one Mailivery test credit. Use the subject and
plain-text body of the first email of the real sequence, and send
`confirm: true`. Retrying the same start returns the test already in progress.
A second test within 24 hours of a completed one is refused.

A test takes about 10-20 minutes after Lifty creates it. Read
`placement_status` again and repeat its `label`; do not compute a verdict
yourself. `uncertain` means Lifty is checking whether Mailivery created the
test and will not create a second one. `did_not_run` is not a placement
result.

When `gates_sending` is true (LIFT client mailboxes), the mailbox can send
campaign email only with a passing test from the last 10 days, after 21 active
warmup days and an explicit operator release. A passing test never releases the
mailbox or starts campaigns by itself. For founders it is advisory.

## Inbox health

To answer how inboxes are doing, what a sender's last placement tests were,
or when an inbox will be ready, use `deliverability` with the explicit
`workspace` in query. Add `sender` (a sender `id` from `senders_get`, or
`unassigned`) or `mailbox`; add `detail: placement` with one
`mailbox_ref` only when the stored test reports are needed. Follow
`next_cursor` until it is null before describing all inboxes.

Report each inbox's `label`, `description` and `reasons` as returned; do not
recalculate health, readiness or dates. A pending or failed test run is not a
placement result, a configured campaign is not evidence of sending, and
missing or out-of-date evidence is not healthy. Workspace health covers the
whole workspace, not one inbox. This read never starts a placement test or
changes sending; propose those only as separate, explicitly requested actions.

## Campaigns and accounts

Campaigns refer to senders. Which of a sender's mailboxes sends is a campaign
decision; a reconnected or replaced mailbox never changes an approved
campaign. A connected account does not authorize any email, message or
invitation: use campaign previews and explicit approval/activation.
Connection can proceed while the sample or new research waits for the weekly
reset.
