# Targeting

Targeting owns the people and company search filters and the personas. Read every saved lane before editing. Filter first: research costs time and budget, so an exclusion a search filter can express belongs here before any research runs (excluded_industry_codes, company.employees, locations). Explain that to the founder in one sentence. Only exclusions that need evidence go to the research criteria.

A lane has personas, seniorities, person_locations and company `{locations, industries, industry_codes, excluded_industry_codes, domains, employees, keywords}`. Lanes have no names; the server assigns lane and persona ids. NAICS industry_codes and excluded_industry_codes use the public 2–6 digit standard; validate codes against the official NAICS reference at https://www.census.gov/naics/ . company.employees is always a list of ordered, non-overlapping `{min, max}` ranges; max null means no ceiling. A persona is `{id, name, titles, persona_type, email_requirement}`; its role and organizational tell belong to the criteria inputs. Allocation and data-quality settings are platform policy, not targeting. Follow references.configuration for each filter's meaning.

PATCH sends expected_version and lanes:

- `{id, ...fields}` changes that lane; omitted fields, including omitted company keys, stay as they are. Null clears a filter.
- A lane without id is added (personas required); the server assigns its id.
- `{id, remove: true}` removes that lane and carries no other keys. At least one lane must remain.

Lanes you do not list stay unchanged. personas, when given, replaces that lane's list: keep each existing persona's id to preserve its identity; a persona without id is new.

A persona change (added, removed, renamed, titles, type or email requirement changed) needs regenerated_criteria in the same PATCH, because the criteria describe the personas: both change together or neither does. regenerated_criteria carries the criteria expected_version and the regenerated text and/or research_fields; author it with references.configuration. Without it the server returns CRITERIA_REGENERATION_REQUIRED and writes nothing. Filter-only edits regenerate nothing.

Changed filters affect the next discovery; people already found are not repeated. After calibration, when several people were disqualified for a reason a filter could cover, propose that filter and explain that it keeps research on people who can fit (references.calibration). On VERSION_CONFLICT read the latest targeting and reapply only the intended change. Initial creation belongs to setup; targeting is never deleted or activated here.

`email_requirement` is `verified` (the default for new personas) or `optional`. Optional email admits email-unavailable prospects only while LinkedIn is active; it never permits email outreach to placeholder addresses. Preserve this field and each stable persona id when renaming or changing titles. Omitting it in PATCH preserves the saved persona policy; omitting it for a new persona defaults to verified.
